Oracle Point in Time Recovery (PITR)
run{
set until time "to_date('08/28/07 15:00:00' , 'mm/dd/yy hh24:mi:ss')";
restore database;
recover database;
alter database open resetlogs;}

Mount the instance

set the environment
. oraenv
> rman TARGET /  NOCATALOG

RMAN:> shutdown immediate;
RMAN:> startup mount;

Restore and recover the datafiles

RMAN> run
{
allocate channel dev1 type disk;
set until time "to_date('2011-12-30:00:00:00', 'yyyy-mm-dd:hh24:mi:ss')";
restore database;
recover database; }

For a large database it can take a long time to restore each tablespace - for better performance during a restore place the RMAN backup files on a separate disk to the Oracle datafiles to reduce disk contention.

Open the database and reset logs

RMAN> alter database open resetlogs;

This will update all current datafiles and online redo logs and all subsequent archived redo logs with a new RESETLOGS SCN and time stamp.

As soon as you have done a resetlogs run a full backup, this is important as should you suffer a second failure you will not be able to perform a second recovery because after resetting the logs the SCN numbers will no longer match any older backup files.
